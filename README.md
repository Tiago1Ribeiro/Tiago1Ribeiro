- 👋 Hi, I’m @Tiago1Ribeiro
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine/Deep Learning, Computer Vision among other things. I am still a beginner and I am currently doing a Masters in Data Science.
- 🌱 I’m focused on image segmentation with TensorFlow/Keras, but I am also learning Hadoop, OpenCV, Hadoop, NLTK, Huggingface Transformers and so much more.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any Computer Vision project, related to microscopy imaging, remote sensing or in artificial intelligence projects applied to audio, for example.
